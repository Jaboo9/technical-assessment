# Technical Assessment

This assessment is based on the [Wine Quality Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) hosted by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

1. Download the data.
2. Consolidate the red and white wine data.
3. Perform an exploratory analysis.
4. On the basis of the exploratory analysis form 3 hypotheses about what factors are most influential to wine quality.
5. Build a model which allows you to assess your hypotheses. In addition, consider the following:

	- How accurate is the model?
	- Which features are the most important? Why?
	- Interpret the effect of these important features.

6. Rigorously quantify the performance of this model.
7. Build a more powerful model.
8. Rigorously quantify the performance of this model.
9. Make predictions for the following wines:

<table>
<tr><td></td><td>Red</td><td>White</td></tr>
</table>
